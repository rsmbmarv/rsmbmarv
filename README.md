- 👋 Hi, I’m @rsmbmarv
- 👀 I’m interested in improving my python skills so I can build better and more complex scripts to automate workflow and scale our productivity at a marketing agency.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning practical-python, and then I'll get onto building some private apps!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on data science, web scraping, and API integrations
- 📫 Hit me up at bmarvin@rsmconnect.com so we can chat!
